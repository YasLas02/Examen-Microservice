#Part 2: Microservices Architecture

# Q1: Define what is a Microservices architecture and how does it differ from a Monolithic          application
        ->Microservices architecture is a software development approach where an application is built as a collection of small, autonomous, and modular services. Each service in a microservices architecture is responsible for a distinct functionality or process and can be developed, deployed, managed, and scaled independently of other services. This contrasts with a monolithic application, where all functionalities are developed within a single, indivisible program, which can make updates and maintenance more complex and risky.

# Q2: Compare Microservices and Monolithic architectures by listing their respective pros and cons.
        ->Microservices architectures offer several advantages such as modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment. However, they can also introduce challenges such as the complexity of managing distributed services and the difficulty of maintaining data consistency. Conversely, monolithic architectures may be simpler to develop and test initially but become more difficult to manage as the application grows, leading to challenges in integrating changes and in scalability.

# Q3: In a Micoservices architecture, explain how should the application be split and why.
        ->In a microservices architecture, the application should be split into services around business capabilities and functional domains. This means identifying functions that can be isolated from each other and have loose coupling with other functions. This approach promotes independence and single responsibility, which enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application.

# Q4: Briefly explain the CAP theorem and its relevance to distributed systems and Microservices.
        ->The CAP theorem posits that it is impossible for a distributed data system to simultaneously offer more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the data), and Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss). In the context of microservices, this influences how services interact and manage data to maintain a balance between these three aspects.

# Q5: What consequences on the architecture ?
        ->Adopting microservices can lead to consequences on architecture, such as the need to manage communication between services, data consistency, and the implementation of service discovery mechanisms. This can also include increased operational complexity and the need for advanced deployment and monitoring practices.

# Q6: Provide an example of how microservices can enhance scalability in a cloud environment.
        ->An example of scalability in a cloud environment is the ability to deploy additional services in response to increased demand. For instance, if a payment processing service experiences high load, it can be scaled out horizontally in the cloud by adding more instances of that service, without disrupting other functionalities of the application.

# Q7: What is statelessness and why is it important in microservices architecture ?
        ->Statelessness means that a service does not retain the state of previous interactions. In a microservices architecture, this is important because it allows each request to be handled independently, improving scalability and resilience. Stateless services are easier to manage as they do not depend on locally stored information, which facilitates their deployment and scalability.

# Q8: What purposes does an API Gateway serve ?
        ->Statelessness means that a service does not retain the state of previous interactions. In a microservices architecture, this is important because it allows each request to be handled independently, improving scalability and resilience. Stateless services are easier to manage as they do not depend on locally stored information, which facilitates their deployment and scalability.
